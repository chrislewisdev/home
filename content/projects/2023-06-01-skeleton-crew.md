Skeleton Crew is an RPG demo for the GameBoy, which I made as part of [GB Compo 23](https://gbdev.io/gbcompo23.html). Actually, at the start of the competition I was working on something entirely different, but with a few weeks left to go I decided that I really didn't like the game I was making, and decided to make this instead. As a result, it's quite sparse in features/content, but it certainly conveys the old-school RPG style that I was going for.

If you'd like to try it out, you can download the ROM on [itch.io](https://staticlinkage.itch.io/skeleton-crew) and play it on your choice of emulator or real hardware!
