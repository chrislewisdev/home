## Sleep Paradox

![](/assets/images/showcase/sleep-paradox.png)

Sleep Paradox is my first game for GBA, and the first game jam entry that I fully collaborated with other gamedevs on. As a result the graphics are much much nicer than my usual work! That said, organising a team proved difficult and in the end we weren't able to complete everything we wanted for the game. What we ended up with though is still a pretty good demo for an action RPG  with some nice pseudo-3d visuals, and I was really proud of the work that went into it.

As usual, you can download the ROM on [itch.io](https://staticlinkage.itch.io/sleep-paradox) and enjoy on an emulator or real hardware.
