## Clean That Castle!

![](/assets/images/showcase/clean-that-castle.png)

"Clean That Castle!" is a puzzle game I made while participating in DOMEjam 2020, using the DOME game framework. I made it over the course of two weekends, and designed the whole game to try and roughly match the specs of the upcoming Playdate handheld system at the time, which was a fun little challenge!

You can [check out the game over on itch.io](https://magspinner.itch.io/clean-that-castle), and if you want you can also [read a retrospective](/posts/domejam-retrospective) I posted on the blog too.
