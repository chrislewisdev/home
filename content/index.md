# About Me
I'm a software developer living in Australia. Work-wise, I tend to find myself working in the land of full-stack development, typically using C# and React to build out product features for web-based systems. But really I'm interested in about any and all aspects of software development, and outside of work I'll just dabble in whatever takes my fancy.

Truth be told, beyond that I'm not too sure what to tell you! But there's probably no better way to give you a feel for me as a person than just showing you some stuff that I've done or made. So check out a random selection of my showcase below, ranging from the new to the considerably not-new.
