## About Me

I'm a software developer living in Australia who likes to build cool stuff, like this website (current iteration: static site built by a custom generator written in Rust, check out the [source code](http://google.com)). You could say my personal quest is to soak up as much knowledge and experience in tech as I can, whether it's building modern cloud-architected systems or dropping down into the low-level details of old gaming handhelds.
